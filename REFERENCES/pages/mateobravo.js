                I am a personal trainer who emphasizes movement education and strength development. I can help with the usual fitness goals like building muscle or losing weight, but what I really enjoy is working with people whose movement issues affect their daily lives and quality of life. I love helping people regain confidence and strength while reducing their pain and fear.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                When I was in my 20s, I had two herniated discs and sciatica. Standard recovery methods didn't provide long lasting benefits. I did it all; physical therapy, massage, chiropractor, acupuncture, cupping, e-stim, percussion, yoga, pilates, foam rollingâ€¦ you name it!
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                It turns out that without movement education and understanding how my body should move and feel during exercise and daily life, many of these efforts can end up a dead end. Once I learned how to move well and added resistance to develop strength in those movements, my back pain became a thing of the past.

              <h2 className="text-orange-300 text-xl font-semibold mb-4">About This Program</h2>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I created this program to share simple, gentle drills and exercises that almost anyone can benefit from. It is very simple, low intensity, low impact, with minimal requirements. It is my first attempt at creating a multi-week program with a specific goal in mind that has PDFs and an application.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                As I improve my resources and workflow methods, I hope to create many more programs for some of the most common requests; such as "Introduction to Bodyweight Exercises for Beginners" and a follow-up intermediate version, and after those would be the transition to "Fundamental Exercises Using Resistance and Load"... and of course "How to Lose Weight".

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My hope is that the feedback I get from folks who use this program will help me to create more of these materials for people in the near future.

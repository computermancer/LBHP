Week 3 - Pelvic Control & Breath Integration
________________


Purpose of This Week
* Reinforce pelvic and ribcage coordination during more dynamic movements.
* Continue developing control in hip hinging and spinal mobility.
* Introduce further rotational patterns for thoracic mobility.
* Enhance breath awareness to support stability and control.
Goals for Week 3
* Build confidence in deeper hip movements and spinal flexion/extension.
* Improve rotational strength and mobility through thoracic and lumbar integration.
* Develop increased control of breath while performing dynamic movements.
* Refine awareness of posture and alignment in different positions.
Tips for Success
* Focus on maintaining a stable pelvis and ribcage through each movement.
* Move with control—prioritize quality over quantity.
* Continue using breath as a guide to enhance movement efficiency.
* Monitor any asymmetries between sides and adjust as needed.

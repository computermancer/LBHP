Week 4 - Rib and Pelvic Stability in Motion
________________


Purpose of This Week
* Integrate dynamic movement patterns with breath and rib control.
* Reinforce strength and stability during more complex movements.
* Develop confidence in advanced hinge and squat patterns.
* Prepare the body for more progressive loaded movements in future programs.
Goals for Week 4
* Improve movement efficiency by combining breath and core control.
* Enhance control of pelvic and ribcage positions during loaded movements.
* Develop strength in hinge, squat, and rotational patterns.
* Increase awareness of balance, stability, and control under dynamic conditions.
Tips for Success
* Maintain steady breathing while performing more complex movements.
* Focus on smooth, controlled transitions between positions.
* Use the breath to stabilize the ribcage and pelvis throughout each movement.
* Be mindful of fatigue—quality of movement is more important than quantity.
